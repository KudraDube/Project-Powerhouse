## 1. Project Overview  
The Powerhouse Bus Booking System is a digital booking platform designed for bus operators and passengers at Powerhouse Bus Station, Braamfontein. The system aims to streamline ticket bookings, reduce overcrowding, minimize fraud, and improve overall passenger experience by leveraging WhatsApp booking and a web-based admin dashboard. Future phases will explore integration with Web3 technologies such as on-chain ticket verification and stablecoin payments.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

- Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that allows passengers to book bus seats via WhatsApp.  
- Provide bus operators with an easy-to-use dashboard to manage seat availability and bookings.  
- Digitize ticketing to reduce manual errors and fraud.  
- Enable seamless digital payment options integrated with local payment gateways.  
- Prepare for future Web3 enhancements including decentralized identity (DID) and blockchain ticket verification.
